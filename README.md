## 1) Linear Regression
- In this project we tried to calculate the CO2 emissions, according to engine size.

## 2) Multiple Linear Regression
- Same logic, only difference is the parameters. This time we use 'ENGINESIZE','CYLINDERS','FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB' for to predict Emissions.

## 3) Non-Linear Regression
- This time x's degree is not 1, so that's why it is non-linear.

## 4) Decision Tree
- Decision tree is one of the most commonly used practical approaches for supervised learning. With a 
particular data point it is run completely through the entirely tree by answering questions till reaches the leaf node.
