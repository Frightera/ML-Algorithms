## 1) Linear Regression
- In this project we tried to calculate the CO2 emissions, according to engine size.

## 2) Multiple Linear Regression
- Same logic, only difference is the parameters. This time we use 'ENGINESIZE','CYLINDERS','FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB' for to predict Emissions.

## 3) Non-Linear Regression
- This time x's degree is not 1, so that's why it is non-linear.

## 4) Decision Tree
- Decision tree is one of the most commonly used practical approaches for supervised learning. With a 
particular data point it is run completely through the entirely tree by answering questions till reaches the leaf node.

## 5) K Nearest Neighbors
- KNN is a supervised learning algorithm that assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories. It is mostly used for classification but can be used for regression as well.
